# Simple Shell, Checks

There will be no checks released before the deadline. We **strongly** encourage the whole class to work together and create a suite of checks covering both regular tests and edged cases for each task.

Here is an example on how to check your shell.
Fork this repo and add more checks to help you and the rest of the class build the best simple shell possible.

## Configuration

Open the file `config` and update the variable `SHELL` with your shell.

## Note for check allowed function
Check_allowed_function : check if there is not allowed function used with the command : /bin/ls
Check_allowed_function_advanced : check if there is not allowed function used with the command : env, ls -la, setenv, unset.

## Run

Usage `./check_simple_shell.bash`
